# Argo Workflow

This repository contains [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows) used by the **Open Forest Observatory (OFO)**. It is being developed to run the [automate-metashape](https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/automate-metashape) pipeline simultaneously across multiple virtual machines on [Jetstream2 Cloud](https://jetstream-cloud.org/). This type of scaling enables us to process many photogrammetry projects simultaneously (instead of sequentially) and vastly reduce total processing time. Argo is meant to work on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/) which orchestrates containers (ie, automate-metashape in docker), scales the processing to multiple VMs, and balances the load between the VMs.

## Setup

### Add drone imagery data to shared volume

https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/

start a new VM from `ofo-dev` image. Make it tiny. Starting an `ofo-dev` VM will automatically attach a shared volume `/ofo-share

location of drone data projects

output path: /ofo-share-serve/argo-output


### Lauch VMs with CACAO

CACAO is an interface for provisioning and launching virtual machines on Jetstream2 Cloud. OFO is using this interface because it has the ability to quickly launch multiple VMs with kubernetes pre-installed. This capability does not currently exist in Exosphere (the default UI for JS2). 

Log into CACAO at https://cacao.jetstream-cloud.org/ using your ACCESS credentials. Before launching VMs, you should [add public ssh keys](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/cacao/credentials/) to CACAO if you would like to acccess VMs from your local IDE. These keys are specific to the local computer you are using. Once your keys are in CACAO, they will be uploaded to any VM you launch in CACAO.
